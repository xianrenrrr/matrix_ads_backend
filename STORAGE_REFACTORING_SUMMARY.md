# Storage Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored storage operations from controllers to DAOs, following proper separation of concerns and clean architecture principles.

## Architecture Changes

### Before
```
Controller → AlibabaOssStorageService (direct dependency)
          → DAO (for database only)
```

### After
```
Controller → DAO → AlibabaOssStorageService
                 → Firestore
```

## Changes Made

### 1. DAO Interfaces Updated

#### VideoDao
- Added `uploadAndSaveVideo()` - handles file upload and database save
- Added `getSignedUrl()` - generates signed URLs for video streaming

#### SceneSubmissionDao
- Added `uploadAndSaveScene()` - handles scene video upload and database save
- Added `getSignedUrl()` - generates signed URLs for scene videos

#### BackgroundMusicDao
- Added `uploadAndSaveBackgroundMusic()` - handles BGM upload with duration extraction and database save

### 2. DAO Implementations Updated

#### VideoDaoImpl
- Autowires `AlibabaOssStorageService`
- Implements upload and signed URL generation methods
- Encapsulates all storage logic

#### SceneSubmissionDaoImpl
- Autowires `AlibabaOssStorageService`
- Implements scene upload with metadata extraction
- Handles file extension detection
- Manages initial AI analysis state

#### BackgroundMusicDaoImpl
- Autowires `AlibabaOssStorageService`
- Implements BGM upload with FFprobe duration extraction
- Handles audio file validation
- Manages temporary file cleanup

### 3. Controllers Simplified

#### VideoController
- Removed direct `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Now calls `videoDao.uploadAndSaveVideo()` instead of handling upload directly
- Uses `videoDao.getSignedUrl()` for streaming

#### BackgroundMusicController
- Removed direct `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Removed `extractAudioDuration()` and `uploadAudioToOSS()` helper methods
- Now calls `bgmDao.uploadAndSaveBackgroundMusic()` for all upload logic

#### SceneSubmissionController
- Removed direct `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Removed `getFileExtension()` helper method
- Now calls `sceneSubmissionDao.uploadAndSaveScene()` for uploads
- Uses `sceneSubmissionDao.getSignedUrl()` for video URLs

#### SceneReviewController
- Removed direct `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Uses `sceneSubmissionDao.getSignedUrl()` for scene streaming

#### ContentManager
- Removed direct `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Uses `videoDao.uploadAndSaveVideo()` for manual template video uploads
- Uses `sceneSubmissionDao.getSignedUrl()` for signed URLs

### 4. Special Cases

#### ImageProxyController
- **Kept** `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Reason: Acts as a proxy/gateway, not a CRUD controller
- Needs direct access to storage service for URL signing in proxy logic

#### TemplateCascadeDeletionService
- **Kept** `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Reason: Service layer that handles cascade deletion across multiple entities
- Directly manages storage cleanup operations

#### VideoCompilationServiceImpl
- **Kept** `AlibabaOssStorageService` dependency
- Reason: Service layer that handles video compilation
- Directly uploads compiled videos to storage

## Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Controllers focus on HTTP request/response handling
- DAOs handle all data persistence (both database and storage)
- Storage service is an implementation detail hidden from controllers

### 2. Testability
- Controllers are easier to test (mock DAO instead of multiple services)
- DAO tests can verify storage operations in isolation
- Reduced number of mock dependencies in controller tests

### 3. Maintainability
- Storage logic centralized in DAOs
- Easier to switch storage providers (only update DAOs)
- No duplicate upload/signing logic across controllers

### 4. Consistency
- All storage operations follow same pattern
- Uniform error handling
- Consistent metadata extraction and validation

## Migration Complete

✅ All controllers migrated from FirebaseStorageService to AlibabaOssStorageService
✅ Storage operations moved to DAO layer
✅ All files compile without errors
✅ Clean architecture principles applied
